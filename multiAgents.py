    Your extreme ghost-hunting, pellet-nabbing, food-gobbling, unstoppable
    evaluation function (question 5).

    DESCRIPTION: 
    * The evaluation function designed rewards the pacman agent inversely proportional to
      the square of manhattan distance to the nearest food and rewards the agent proportional
      to the manhattan distance to the nearest ghost.

    * This can be expressed by the following formula: 
        evaluationFunction = current_score * âˆ‘(distance_to_ghost/(total_distance_to_food^2)) + 0.1 (bias)

    * In this, bias is chosen to prevent from 0 score which implies that the pacman is at a goal state which
    may not always be the case.

    * In layman terms, what this means is the following:
        - The farther the ghost from pacman, the higher the score.
        - The closer the food from pacman, the higher the score.
    
    * Reason for using squared proportion:
        This was used based on pure trial and error. After using different approaches,
        squared heuristic proved to be the most sensical because pacman should try his
        best to live than eat the nearest food. This is because the game doesn't end if
        pacman is unable to eat food, but ends if it comes under contact with ghost (without sudo mode).
        - This shows that the pacman should value proxmity to the ghost more than proximity to the nearest food-pellet.

    # Note: The logic of this code is reused from problem 1 of this assignment, because it's a powerful heuristic.
